    <h4> C HTML GRAPICS</h4>
        <h4>C1 HTML CANVAS</h4>
        <p>
            HTML Canvas Graphics<br>
            The HTML canvas element is used to draw graphics on a web page.<br>
            
            The graphic to the left is created with canvas. It shows four elements: a red rectangle, a gradient rectangle, a multicolor rectangle, and a multicolor text.<br>
            
            What is HTML Canvas?<br>
            The HTML canvas element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.<br>
            
            The canvas element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.<br>
            
            Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.<br>
            Browser Support<br>
            The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the canvas element.<br>
            Add a JavaScript<br>
After creating the rectangular canvas area, you must add a JavaScript to do the drawing.<br>

         <h4> C2 HTML SVG</h4>
         <p>
            HTML SVG Graphics<br>
            SVG defines vector-based graphics in XML format.<br>
            
            What is SVG?<br>
            SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics<br>
            SVG is used to define graphics for the Web<br>
            SVG is a W3C recommendation<br>
            The HTML svg Element<br>
            The HTML svg element is a container for SVG graphics.<br>
            
            SVG has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.<br>
            
            Browser Support<br>
            The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the svg element.<br>
            Differences Between SVG and Canvas<br>
            SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML.<br>
            
            Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with a JavaScript).<br>
            SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element.<br>
            
            In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.<br>
            
            Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser. If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic.<br>

                Comparison of Canvas and SVG
The table below shows some important differences between Canvas and SVG:

Canvas	SVG
Resolution dependent
No support for event handlers
Poor text rendering capabilities
You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
Well suited for graphic-intensive games
Resolution independent
Support for event handlers
Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps)
Slow rendering if complex (anything that uses the DOM a lot will be slow)
Not suited for game applications
