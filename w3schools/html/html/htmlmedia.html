             HTML Multimedia<br>
             Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, movies, and animations.<br>
             
             What is Multimedia?<br>
             Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see, like images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.<br>
             
             Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats.<br>
             
             Browser Support<br>
             The first web browsers had support for text only, limited to a single font in a single color.<br>
             
             Later came browsers with support for colors, fonts, images, and multimedia!<br>
             
             Multimedia Formats<br>
             Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files.<br>
             
             The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension.<br>
             
             Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.<br>
             Common Video Formats<br>
             There are many video formats out there.<br>

             The MP4, WebM, and Ogg formats are supported by HTML.<br>
             
             The MP4 format is recommended by YouTube.<br>

             The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.<br>
             
             It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.<br>
             
             The source element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.<br>
             The text between the video and video tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the video element.<br>
             
             HTML video Autoplay<br>
             To start a video automatically, use the autoplay attribute:<br>

       <h4>  D4 HTML PLU-INS</h4>
       <p>
           HTML Plug-ins<br>
           Plug-ins are computer programs that extend the standard functionality of the browser.<br>
           
           Plug-ins<br>
           Plug-ins were designed to be used for many different purposes:<br>
           
           To run Java applets<br>
           To run Microsoft ActiveX controls<br>
           To display Flash movies<br>
           To display maps<br>
           To scan for viruses<br>
           To verify a bank id<br>
           Warning !<br>
           
           Most browsers no longer support Java Applets and Plug-ins.<br>
           
           ActiveX controls are no longer supported in any browsers.<br>
           
           The support for Shockwave Flash has also been turned off in modern browsers.<br>
           
           The object Element<br>
           The object element is supported by all browsers.<br>
           
           The object element defines an embedded object within an HTML document.<br>
           
           It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash Players) in web pages, but can also be used to include HTML in HTML:<br>
           The embed Element<br>
               The embed element is supported in all major browsers.<br>
               
               The embed element also defines an embedded object within an HTML document.<br>
               
               Web browsers have supported the embed element for a long time. However, it has not been a part of the HTML specification before HTML5<br>
               Note that the embed element does not have a closing tag. It can not contain alternative text.<br>

                   The embed element can also be used to include HTML in HTML:<br>

       </p>
        <h4>D5 HTML YOUTUBE</h4>
        <p>
           HTML YouTube Videos<br>
           The easiest way to play videos in HTML, is to use YouTube.<br>
           
           Struggling with Video Formats?<br>
           Converting videos to different formats can be difficult and time-consuming.<br>
           
           An easier solution is to let YouTube play the videos in your web page.<br>
           
           YouTube Video Id<br>
           YouTube will display an id (like tgbNymZ7vqY), when you save (or play) a video.<br>
           
           You can use this id, and refer to your video in the HTML code.<br>
           
           Playing a YouTube Video in HTML<br>
           To play your video on a web page, do the following:<br>
           
           Upload the video to YouTube<br>
           Take a note of the video id<br>
           Define an iframe element in your web page<br>
           Let the src attribute point to the video URL<br>
           Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player<br>
           Add any other parameters to the URL (see below)<br>
           YouTube Autoplay + Mute<br>
           You can let your video start playing automatically when a user visits the page, by adding autoplay=1 to the YouTube URL. However, automatically starting a video is annoying for your visitors!<br>
           Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.<br>
           
           Add mute=1 after autoplay=1 to let your video start playing automatically (but muted).<br>
           YouTube Playlist<br>
A comma separated list of videos to play (in addition to the original URL).<br>

YouTube Loop<br>
Add loop=1 to let your video loop forever.<br>

Value 0 (default): The video will play only once.<br>

Value 1: The video will loop (forever).<br>
YouTube Controls<br>
Add controls=0 to not display controls in the video player.<br>

Value 0: Player controls does not display.<br>

Value 1 (default): Player controls display.<br>
