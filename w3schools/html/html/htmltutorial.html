      HTML Tutorial<br>
      HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.<br>
      
      With HTML you can create your own Website.<br>

    <h4> A2 HTML INTRODUCTION</h4>
    <p>
      HTML Introduction<br>
      HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.<br>
      
      What is HTML?<br>
      HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language<br>
      HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages<br>
      HTML describes the structure of a Web page<br>
      HTML consists of a series of elements<br>
      HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content<br>
      HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.<br>
      What is an HTML Element?<br>
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:<br>

tagnameContent goes here../tagname<br>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:<br>
Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like thebr element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!<br>
Web Browsers<br>
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.<br>

A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:<br>
HTML Page Structure<br>
Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:<br>
Note: The content inside the body section (the white area above) will be displayed in a browser. The content inside the title element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.<br>

    <h4>A3 HTML EDITORS</h4>
    <p>
      HTML Editors<br>
      A simple text editor is all you need to learn HTML.<br>
      
      Learn HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit<br>
      Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.<br>
      
      However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).<br>
      
      We believe in that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.<br>
      
      Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.<br>
      
      Step 1: Open Notepad (PC)<br>
      Windows 8 or later:<br>
      
      Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad.<br>
      
      Windows 7 or earlier:<br>
      
      Open Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad<br>
      
      Step 1: Open TextEdit (Mac)<br>
      Open Finder > Applications > TextEdit<br>
      
      Also change some preferences to get the application to save files correctly. In Preferences > Format > choose "Plain Text"<br>
      
      Then under "Open and Save", check the box that says "Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text".<br>
      
      Then open a new document to place the code.<br>
      
      Step 2: Write Some HTML<br>
      Write or copy the following HTML code into Notepad:<br>
      Step 3: Save the HTML Page<br>
Save the file on your computer. Select File > Save as in the Notepad menu.<br>

Name the file "index.htm" and set the encoding to UTF-8 (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files).<br>
Tip: You can use either .htm or .html as file extension. There is no difference, it is up to you.<br>
Step 4: View the HTML Page in Your Browser<br>
Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with").<br>

    <h4>A4 HTML BASIC</h4>
    <p>
      HTML Basic Examples<br>
      In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.<br>
      
      Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.<br>
      
      HTML Documents<br>
      All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: !DOCTYPE html.<br>
      
      The HTML document itself begins with html and ends with html.<br>
      
      The visible part of the HTML document is between body and body.<br>
      The !DOCTYPE> Declaration<br>
The !DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.<br>

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).<br>

The !DOCTYPE declaration is not case sensitive.<br>

The !DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5 is:<br>
HTML Headings<br>
HTML headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags.<br>

h1 defines the most important heading. h6 defines the least important heading: <br>
HTML Paragraphs<br>
HTML paragraphs are defined with the p tag:<br>
HTML Links<br>
HTML links are defined with the a tag:<br>
The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. <br>

Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.<br>
HTML Images<br>
HTML images are defined with the img tag.<br>

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:<br>
How to View HTML Source?<br>
Have you ever seen a Web page and wondered "Hey! How did they do that?"<br>

View HTML Source Code:<br>
Right-click in an HTML page and select "View Page Source" (in Chrome) or "View Source" (in Edge), or similar in other browsers. This will open a window containing the HTML source code of the page.<br>

Inspect an HTML Element:<br>
Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" to see what elements are made up of (you will see both the HTML and the CSS). You can also edit the HTML or CSS on-the-fly in the Elements or Styles panel that opens.<br>


    </p>
      <h4>A5 HTML ELEMENTS</h4>
      
      <p>
          HTML Elements<br>
          An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.<br>
          
          HTML Elements<br>
          The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:<br>
          note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the br element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!<br>

Nested HTML Elements<br>
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).<br>

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.<br>

The following example contains four HTML elements (html, body, h1 and p):<br>
Never Skip the End Tag<br>
Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:<br>
Empty HTML Elements<br>
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.<br>

The br tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:<br>
HTML is Not Case Sensitive<br>
HTML tags are not case sensitive: P means the same as p.<br>

The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.<br>
<xmp>
  HTML Tag Reference
W3Schools' tag reference contains additional information about these tags and their attributes.

Tag	Description
<html>     	Defines the root of an HTML document
<body>       	Defines the document's body
<h1> to <h6>	Defines HTML headings
</xmp>

      </p>

      <h4>A6 HTML ATTRIBUTES</h4>
      <p>
          HTML Attributes<br>
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.<br>

HTML Attributes<br>
All HTML elements can have attributes<br>
Attributes provide additional information about elements<br>
Attributes are always specified in the start tag<br>
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"<br>
The href Attribute<br>
The a tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:<br>
The src Attribute<br>
The  img tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:<br>
There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:<br>

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.91hub.in/images/img_girl.jpg".<br>

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.<br>

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".<br>

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.<br>

The width and height Attributes<br>
The img tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels):<br>
The alt Attribute<br>
The required alt attribute for the img tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.<br>
The style Attribute<br>
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.<br>
The lang Attribute<br>
You should always include the lang attribute inside the html tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.<br>
Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.<br>
The title Attribute<br>
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.<br>

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:<br>
We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes<br>
The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.<br>

The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.<br>

However, W3C recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, and demands lowercase attributes for stricter document types like XHTML.<br>

At W3Schools we always use lowercase attribute names.<br>

We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values<br>
The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.<br>

However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.<br>
At W3Schools we always use quotes around attribute values.<br>

Single or Double Quotes?<br>
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.<br>

In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:<br>
Chapter Summary<br>
All HTML elements can have attributes<br>
The href attribute of  a specifies the URL of the page the link goes to<br>
The src attribute of img  specifies the path to the image to be displayed<br>
The width and height attributes of  img  provide size information for images<br>
The alt attribute of img  provides an alternate text for an image<br>
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more<br>
The lang attribute of the html tag declares the language of the Web page<br>
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element<br>

      <h4>A7 HTML HEADINGS</h4>
      <p>
          HTML Headings<br>
HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.<br>
HTML Headings<br>
HTML headings are defined with the  h1 to h6  tags.<br>

h1 defines the most important heading. h6  defines the least important heading.<br>
Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.<br>

Headings Are Important<br>
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.<br>

Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.<br>

h1 headings should be used for main headings, followed by h2 headings, then the less important h3, and so on.<br>

Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.<br>

Bigger Headings<br>
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:<br>
<xmp>
  HTML Tag Reference
  W3Schools' tag reference contains additional information about these tags and their attributes.
  
  Tag	Description
  html      	Defines the root of an HTML document
  body      	Defines the document's body
  h1 to h6	Defines HTML headings
</xmp>

      </p>
      <h4>A8 HTML PARAGRAPHS</h4>
      <p>
          HTML Paragraphs<br>
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.<br>

HTML Paragraphs<br>
The HTML p element defines a paragraph.<br>

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.<br>
HTML Display<br>
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.<br>

Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.<br>

With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.<br>

The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:<br>
HTML Horizontal Rules<br>
The hr tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.<br>

The hr element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:<br>
The hr tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.<br>

HTML Line Breaks<br>
The HTML br element defines a line break.<br>

Use br if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:<br>
The br tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.<br>
Solution - The HTML pre Element<br>
  The HTML pre element defines preformatted text.<br>
  
  The text inside a pre element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:<br>
 <xmp>
  HTML Tag Reference
  W3Schools' tag reference contains additional information about HTML elements and their attributes.
  
  Tag	Description
  <p>	Defines a paragraph
  <hr>	Defines a thematic change in the content
  <br>	Inserts a single line break
  <pre>	Defines pre-formatted text

 </xmp>
      </p>
      <h4>A9 HTML STYLES</h4>
      <p>
          HTML Styles<br>
The HTML style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.<br>
The HTML Style Attribute<br>
Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.<br>

The HTML style attribute has the following syntax:<br>
Background Color<br>
The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element.<br>
Text Color<br>
The CSS color property defines the text color for an HTML element:<br>
Fonts<br>
The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element:<br>
Text Size<br>
The CSS font-size property defines the text size for an HTML element:<br>
Text Alignment<br>
The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element:<br>
Chapter Summary<br>
Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements<br>
Use background-color for background color<br>
Use color for text colors<br>
Use font-family for text fonts<br>
Use font-size for text sizes<br>
Use text-align for text alignment<br>


      </p>
   <h4>A10 HTML FORMATTING</h4>
   <p>
      HTML Text Formatting<br>
      HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.<br>
      HTML Formatting Elements<br>
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:<br>

b - Bold text<br>
strong - Important text<br>
i - Italic text<br>
em - Emphasized text<br>
mark - Marked text<br>
small - Smaller text<br>
del - Deleted text<br>
ins - Inserted text<br>
sub - Subscript text<br>
sup - Superscript text<br>
HTML b and strong Elements<br>
The HTML b element defines bold text, without any extra importance.<br>
TheHTML i and em Elements<br>
  The HTML i element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.<br>
  
  Tip: The i tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc. HTML strong element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.<br>
  The HTML em  element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.<br>

      Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in em  with an emphasis, using verbal stress.<br>
      HTML mark Element<br>
          The HTML mark element defines text that should be marked or highlighted:<br>
          HTML del Element<br>
              The HTML del element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text:<br>
              HTML ins Element<br>
                  The HTML ins element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text:<br>
                  HTML sub Element<br>
                      The HTML sub element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O:<br>
                      HTML sup Element<br>
                          The HTML sup element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like WWW[1]:<br>
<xmp>

   </p>
  <h4>A>11 HTML QUOTATIONS </h4>
  <p>
      HTML Quotation and Citation Elements<br>
In this chapter we will go through the blockquote,q, abbr, address, cite, and bdo HTML elements.<br>
HTML blockquote for Quotations<br>
  The HTML blockquote element defines a section that is quoted from another source.<br>
  
  Browsers usually indent blockquote elements.<br>
  HTML q for Short Quotations<br>
      The HTML q tag defines a short quotation.<br>
      
      Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.<br>
      HTML abbr for Abbreviations<br>
          The HTML abbr tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".<br>
          
          Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.<br>
          
          Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.<br>
          HTML address for Contact Information<br>
              The HTML address tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.<br>
              
              The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.
              
              The text in the address element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the address element.<br>
              HTML cite for Work Title<br>
                  The HTML cite tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).<br>
                  HTML bdo for Bi-Directional Override<br>
                      BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.<br>
                      
                      The HTML bdo tag is used to override the current text direction:<br>
                      <xmp>

  </p>
<h4>A12 HTML COMMENTS</h4>
<p>
  HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.<br>

  HTML Comment Tags<br>
  You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:<br>
  Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.<br>

Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.<br>

With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:<br>
Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors:<br>


</p>
  <h4>A13 HTML COLORS</h4>
  
  <h4> A13A COLORS</h4> 
  <p>
      HTML Colors<br>
HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA values.<br>

Color Names<br>
In HTML, a color can be specified by using a color name:<br>
Background Color<br>
You can set the background color for HTML elements:<br>
Text Color<br>
You can set the color of text:<br>
Border Color<br>
You can set the color of borders:<br>
Color Values<br>
In HTML, colors can also be specified using RGB values, HEX values, HSL values, RGBA values, and HSLA values.<br>

The following three div elements have their background color set with RGB, HEX, and HSL values:<br>
The following two div elements have their background color set with RGBA and HSLA values, which adds an Alpha channel to the color (here we have 50% transparency):<br>


  </p>
  <h4>A13B RGB</h4>
  <p>
      HTML RGB and RGBA Colors<br>
An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.<br>

An RGBA color value is an extension of RGB with an Alpha channel (opacity).<br>

RGB Color Values<br>
In HTML, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:<br>

rgb(red, green, blue)<br>

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255.<br>

This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors!<br>

For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0.<br>

Another example, rgb(0, 255, 0) is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 0.<br>

To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).<br>

To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).<br>

Experiment by mixing the RGB values below:<br>
Shades of Gray<br>
Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all three parameters:<br>
RGBA Color Values<br>
RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.<br>

An RGBA color value is specified with:<br>

rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)<br>
The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):<br>

Experiment by mixing the RGBA values below:<br>


  </p>
  <h4>A13C HEX</h4>
  <p>
      HTML HEX Colors<br>
A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.<br>

HEX Color Values<br>
In HTML, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:<br>

#rrggbb<br>

Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).<br>

For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 00.<br>

Another example, #00ff00 is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 00.<br>

To display black, set all color parameters to 00, like this: #000000.<br>

To display white, set all color parameters to ff, like this: #ffffff.<br>
Experiment by mixing the HEX values below:<br>
Shades of Gray<br>
Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all three parameters:<br>
elowHTML HSL and HSLA Colors<br>

<h4> A13D HSL </h4>
<p>
  HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.<br>

  HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity).<br>
  
  HSL Color Values<br>
  In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:<br>
  
  hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)<br>
  
  Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.<br>
  
  Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.<br>
  
  Lightness is also a percentage value, 0% is black, and 100% is white.<br>
  
  Experiment by mixing the HSL values b<br>
  Saturation<br>
Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.<br>

100% is pure color, no shades of gray<br>

50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.<br>

0% is completely gray, you can no longer see the color.<br>
Lightness<br>
The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light) 100% means full lightness (white).<br>
Shades of Gray<br>
Shades of gray are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjust the lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades:<br>
HSLA Color Values<br>
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.<br>

An HSLA color value is specified with:<br>

hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)<br>

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):<br>

Experiment by mixing the HSLA values below:<br>

 <h4>A14 HTML CSS </h4>
 <p>
  HTML Styles - CSS<br>
  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.<br>
  
  CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.<br>
  
  What is CSS?<br>
  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.<br>
  
  With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!<br>
  
  Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!<br>
  
  Using CSS<br>
  CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:<br>
  
  Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements<br>
  Internal - by using a style element in the head section<br>
  External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file<br>
  The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.<br>
  
  Inline CSS<br>
  An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.<br>
  
  An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.<br>
  
  The following example sets the text color of the h1 element to blue, and the text color of the p element to red:<br>
  Internal CSS<br>
  An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.<br>
  
  An internal CSS is defined in the head section of an HTML page, within a style element.<br>
  External CSS<br>
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.<br>

To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the head>section of each HTML page:<br>
The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.<br>
Tip: With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file!<br>

CSS Colors, Fonts and Sizes<br>
Here, we will demonstrate some commonly used CSS properties. You will learn more about them later.<br>

The CSS color property defines the text color to be used.<br>

The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.<br>

The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used.<br>
CSS Border
The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element.<br>

Tip: You can define a border for nearly all HTML elements.<br>
CSS Padding
The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.<br>
CSS Margin<br>
The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border.<br>
Link to External CSS<br>
External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.<br>
Chapter Summary<br>
Use the HTML style attribute for inline styling<br>
Use the HTML style element to define internal CSS<br>
Use the HTML link element to refer to an external CSS file<br>
Use the HTML head element to store style and link elements<br>
Use the CSS color property for text colors<br>
Use the CSS font-family property for text fonts<br>
Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes<br>
Use the CSS border property for borders<br>
Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border<br>
Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border<br>

 <h4>A15 HTML LINKS</h4>
 
  <h4> A15A LINKS </h4>
  <p>
      HTML Links<br>
      Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.<br>
      
      HTML Links - Hyperlinks<br>
      HTML links are hyperlinks.<br>
      
      You can click on a link and jump to another document.<br>
      
      When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.<br>
      
      Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!<br>
      
      HTML Links - Syntax<br>
      The HTML a tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:<br>
          The most important attribute of the a element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.<br>
  
              The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.<br>
              By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:<br>

An unvisited link is underlined and blue<br>
A visited link is underlined and purple<br>
An active link is underlined and red<br>
Tip: Links can of course be styled with CSS, to get another look!<br>

HTML Links - The target Attribute<br>
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.<br>

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.<br>

The target attribute can have one of the following values:<br>

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked<br>
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab<br>
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame<br>
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window<br>
Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs<br>
Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.<br>

A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):<br>
HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link<br>
To use an image as a link, just put the img tag inside the a tag:<br>
Link to an Email Address<br>
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):<br>
Button as a Link<br>
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.<br>

JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:<br>
Link Titles<br>
The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.<br>
More on Absolute URLs and Relative URLs<br>
Chapter Summary<br>
Use the a element to define a link<br>
Use the href attribute to define the link address<br>
Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document<br>
Use the img element (inside a) to use an image as a link<br>
Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program<br>

  <h4> A15B  COLORS</h4>
  <p>
      HTML Links - Different Colors<br>
An HTML link is displayed in a different color depending on whether it has been visited, is unvisited, or is active.<br>

HTML Link Colors<br>
By default, a link<br> will appear like this (in all browsers):<br>

An unvisited link is underlined and blue<br>
A visited link is underlined and purple<br>
An active link is underlined and red<br>
You can change the link state colors, by using CSS:<br>
Link Buttons<br>
A link can also be styled as a button, by using CSS:<br>

      <h4> A15C   BOOKMARKS</h4>
      <p>
          HTML Links - Create Bookmarks<br>
HTML links can be used to create bookmarks, so that readers can jump to specific parts of a web page.<br>

Create a Bookmark in HTML<br>
Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.<br>

To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link to it.<br>

When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark.<br>
Chapter Summary<br>
Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page<br>
Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark<br>

 <h4>A16 HTML IMAGES</h4>
<h4>  A16A IMAGES</h4>

<p>
  HTML Images<br>
  Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.<br>
  HTML Images Syntax<br>
The HTML img tag is used to embed an image in a web page.<br>

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The img tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.<br>

The img tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.<br>

The img tag has two required attributes:<br>

src - Specifies the path to the image<br>
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image<br>
The src Attribute<br>
The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.<br>

Note: When a web page loads; it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.<br>
The alt Attribute<br>
The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).<br>

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:<br>
If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt attribute:<br>
Tip: A screen reader is a software program that reads the HTML code, and allows the user to "listen" to the content. Screen readers are useful for people who are visually impaired or learning disabled.<br>

Image Size - Width and Height<br>
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.<br>
Alternatively, you can use the width and height attributes:<br>
The width and height attributes always define the width and height of the image in pixels.<br>

Note: Always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the web page might flicker while the image loads.<br>

Width and Height, or Style?<br>
The width, height, and style attributes are all valid in HTML.<br>

However, we suggest using the style attribute. It prevents styles sheets from changing the size of images:<br>
Images in Another Folder<br>
If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute:<br>
Images on Another Server/Website
Some web sites point to an image on another server.<br>

To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute:<br>
Notes on external images: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.<br>

Animated Images<br>
HTML allows animated GIFs:<br>
Image as a Link<br>
To use an image as a link, put the img tag inside the a tag:<br>
Image Floating<br>
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text:<br>
Common Image Formats<br>
Here are the most common image file types, which are supported in all browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera):<br>
Chapter Summary<br>
Use the HTML img element to define an image<br>
Use the HTML src attribute to define the URL of the image<br>
Use the HTML alt attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed<br>
Use the HTML width and height attributes or the CSS width and height properties to define the size of the image<br>
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the left or to the right<br>
Note: Loading large images takes time, and can slow down your web page. Use images carefully.<br>

  HTML Image Tags
Tag	Description
<img>   	Defines an image
<map>	    Defines an image map
<area>  	Defines a clickable area inside an image map
<picture>	Defines a container for multiple image resources
</xmp>

</p>
  <h4> A16B IMAGE MAP</h4>
  <p>
      HTML Image Maps<br>
With HTML image maps, you can create clickable areas on an image.<br>

Image Maps<br>
The HTML map tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more area tags.<br>
How Does it Work?<br>
The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click.<br>

To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas.<br>
The Image<br>
The image is inserted using the img tag. The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute:<br>
The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.<br>

Tip: You can use any image as an image map!<br>

Create Image Map<br>
Then, add a map element.<br>

The map element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute:<br>
The name attribute must have the same value as the img's usemap attribute .<br>

The Areas<br>
Then, add the clickable areas.<br>

A clickable area is defined using an area element.<br>
<br>
Shape
You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:<br>

rect - defines a rectangular region<br>
circle - defines a circular region<br>
poly - defines a polygonal region<br>
default - defines the entire region<br>
You must also define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the image. <br>

Shape="rect"<br>
The coordinates for shape="rect" come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.<br>

So, the coordinates 34,44 is located 34 pixels from the left margin and 44 pixels from the top:<br>
Shape="circle"<br>
To add a circle area, first locate the coordinates of the center of the circle:<br>

337,300<br>
Shape="poly"<br>
The shape="poly" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon).<br>
Image Map and JavaScript<br>
A clickable area can also trigger a JavaScript function.<br>

Add a click event to the area element to execute a JavaScript function:<br>
Chapter Summary<br>
Use the HTML map element to define an image map<br>
Use the HTML area element to define the clickable areas in the image map<br>
Use the HTML usemap attribute of the img element to point to an image map<br>

  </p>
      <h4> A16C BACKGROUND IMAGES</h4>
       <p>
          HTML Background Images<br>
          A background image can be specified for almost any HTML element.<br>
          
          Background Image on a HTML element<br>
          To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property:<br>
          You can also specify the background image in the style element, in the head section:<br>
          Background Image on a Page<br>
If you want the entire page to have a background image, you must specify the background image on the body element:<br>
Background Repeat<br>
If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, until it reaches the end of the element:<br>
To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property to no-repeat.<br>
Background Cover<br>
If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.<br>

Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed:<br>

This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions):<br>
Background Stretch<br>
If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, you can set the background-size property to 100% 100%:<br>



      </p>
   <h4> A16D THE PICTURE ELEMENTS</h4>
   <p>
       HTML picture Element<br>
      The HTML picture element allows you to display different pictures for different devices or screen sizes.<br>
      The HTML picture Element
          The HTML picture element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.<br>
          
          The picture element contains one or more source elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute. This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device.<br>
          
          Each source element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.<br>
          Note: Always specify an img element as the last child element of the picture element. The img element is used by browsers that do not support the picture element, or if none of the source tags match.<br>

              When to use the Picture Element<br>
              There are two main purposes for the picture element:<br>
              
              1. Bandwidth<br>
              If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file. The browser will use the first source element with matching attribute values, and ignore any of the following elements.<br>
              
              2. Format Support<br>
              Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the picture element, you can add images of all formats, and the browser will use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the following elements.<br>
              Note: The browser will use the first source element with matching attribute values, and ignore any following source elements.<br>

    <h4>A17 HTML TABLES</h4>
     <h4> A17A  HTML TABLES</h4>
     <p>
      HTML Tables<br>
      HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.<br>
      Define an HTML Table<br>
A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns<br>
Table Cells<br>
Each table cell is defined by a td and a td tag.<br>

td stands for table data.<br>

Everything between td and td are the content of the table cell.<br>
Note: table data elements are the data containers of the table.<br>
They can contain all sorts of HTML elements; text, images, lists, other tables, etc.<br>
Table Rows<br>
Each table row starts with a tr and end with a tr tag.<br>

tr stands for table row.<br>
You can have as many rows as you like in a table, just make sure that the number of cells are the same in each row.<br>

Note: There are times where a row can have less or more cells than another. You will learn about that in a later chapter.<br>

Table Headers<br>
Sometimes you want your cells to be headers, in those cases use the th tag instead of the td tag:<br>
By default, the text in th elements are bold and centered, but you can change that with CSS<br>
<xmp>
HTML Table Tags
Tag	Description
<table>	Defines a table
<th>	Defines a header cell in a table
<tr>	Defines a row in a table
<td>	Defines a cell in a table
<caption>	Defines a table caption
<colgroup>	Specifies a group of one or more columns in a table for formatting
<col>	Specifies column properties for each column within a <colgroup> element
<thead>	Groups the header content in a table
<tbody>	Groups the body content in a table
<tfoot>	Groups the footer content in a table

</xmp>
     </p>
  <h4>  A17B   TABLE BORDERS </h>
      <p>
          HTML Table Borders<br>
HTML tables can have borders of different styles and shapes.<br>

How To Add a Border<br>
When you add a border to a table, you also add borders around each table cell:<br>
To add a border, use the CSS border property on table, th, and td elements:<br>
Collapsed Table Borders<br>
To avoid having double borders like in the example above, set the CSS border-collapse property to collapse.<br>

This will make the borders collapse into a single border:<br>
Style Table Borders<br>
If you set a background color of each cell, and give the border a white color (the same as the document background), you get the impression of an invisible border:<br>
Round Table Borders<br>
With the border-radius property, the borders get rounded corners:<br>
Skip the border around the table by leaving out table from the css selector:<br>
  </p>
      <h4>   A17C    TABLE SIZES </h4> 
      <p>
          HTML Table Sizes<br>
          HTML tables can have different sizes for each column, row or the entire table.<br>
          Use the style attribute with the width or height properties to specify the size of a table, row or column.<br>

HTML Table Width<br>
To set the width of a table, add the style attribute to the table element:<br>
Note: Using a percentage as the size unit for a width means how wide will this element be compared to its parent element, which in this case is the body element.<br>

      HTML Table Row Height<br>
      HTML Table Column Width <br>
             HTML Table Row Height<br>

  To set the size of a specific column, add the style attribute on a th or td element:<br>
      HTML Table Row Height<br>
      To set the height of a specific row, add the style attribute on a table row element:<br>

      </p>
  <h4> A17D    TABLE HEADERS</h4>
  <p>
      HTML Table Headers<br>
      HTML tables can have headers for each column or row, or for many columns/rows.<br>
      HTML Table Headers<br>
Table headers are defined with th elements, each th element represents a table cell.<br>
Vertical Table Headers<br>
To use the first column as table headers, define the first cell in each row as a th element:<br>
Align Table Headers<br>
By default, table headers are bold and centered:<br>
To left-align the table headers, use the CSS text-align property:<br>
Header for Multiple Columns<br>
You can have a header that spans over two or more columns.<br>
To do this, use the colspan attribute on the th element<br>
Table Caption<br>
You can add a caption that serves as a heading for the entire table<br>
To add a caption to a table, use the caption tag:<br>
Note: The caption tag should be inserted immediately after the table tag.<br>
      
  </p>
   <h4> A17E   PADDING & SPACING </h4>
   <p>
      HTML Table Padding & Spacing<br>
      HTML tables can adjust the padding inside the cells, and also the space between the cells.<br>
      HTML Table - Cell Padding<br>
Cell padding is the space between the cell edges and the cell content.<br>

By default the padding is set to 0.<br>

To add padding on table cells, use the CSS padding property:<br>
To add padding only above the content, use the padding-top property.<br>

And the others sides with the padding-bottom, padding-left, and padding-right properties:<br>
HTML Table - Cell Spacing<br>
Cell spacing is the space between each cell.<br>

By default the space is set to 2 pixels.<br>

To change the space between table cells, use the CSS border-space property on the table element:<br>
      

   </p>
   <h4>  A17F   COLSPAN & ROWSPAN </h4>
   <p>
      HTML Table Colspan & Rowspan<br>
      HTML tables can have cells that spans over multiple rows and/or columns.<br>
      HTML Table - Colspan<br>
To make a cell span over multiple columns, use the colspan attribute:<br>
Note: The value of the colspan attribute represents the number of columns to span.<br>

HTML Table - Rowspan<br>
To make a cell span over multiple rows, use the rowspan attribute:<br>
Note: The value of the rowspan attribute represents the number of rows to span.<br>
      

   </p>
<h4>  A17G   STYLINGB</h4>
<p>
  HTML Table Styling<br>
  Use CSS to make your tables look better.<br>
  
  HTML Table - Zebra Stripes<br>
  If you add a background color on every other table row, you will get a nice zebra stripes effect.<br>
  To style every other table row element, use the :nth-child(even) selector like this:<br>
  Note: If you use (odd) instead of (even), the styling will occur on row 1,3,5 etc. instead of 2,4,6 etc.<br>

HTML Table - Vertical Zebra Stripes<br>
To make vertical zebra stripes, style every other column, instead of every other row.<br>
Set the :nth-child(even) for table data elements like this:<br>
Note: Put the :nth-child() selector on both th and td elements if you want to have the styling on both headers and regular table cells.<br>
Combine Vertical and Horizontal Zebra Stripes<br>
You can combine the styling from the two examples above and you will have stripes on every other row and every other column.<br>

If you use a transparent color you will get an overlapping effect.<br>
Use an rgba() color to specify the transparency of the color:<br>
Horizontal Dividers<br>
If you specify borders only at the bottom of each table row, you will have a table with horizontal dividers.<br>

Add the border-bottom property to all tr elements to get horizontal dividers:<br>
Hoverable Table<br>
Use the :hover selector on tr to highlight table rows on mouse over:<br>


</p>
      <h4>  A17H    TABLE COLGROUP </h4>
      <p>
          HTML Table Colgroup<br>
The colgroup element is used to style specific columns of a table.<br>

HTML Table Colgroup<br>
If you want to style the two first columns of a table, use the colgroup and col elements.<br>
The colgroup element should be used as a container for the column specifications.<br>

  Each group are specified with a col element.<br>
  
  The span attribute specifies how many columns that gets the style.<br>
  
  The style attribute specifies the style to give the columns.<br>
  Note: The colgroup tag must be a child of a table element and should be placed before any other table elements, like thead, tr, td etc., but after the caption element, if present.<br>

      Legal CSS Properties<br>
      There are only a very limited selection of CSS properties that are allowed to be used in the colgroup:<br>
      
      width property<br>
      visibility property<br>
      background properties<br>
      border properties<br>
      
      All other CSS properties will have no effect on your tables.<br>
      Multiple Col Elements<br>
If you want to style more columns with different styles, use more col elements inside the colgroup:<br>
Empty Colgroups<br>
If you want to style columns in the middle of a table, insert a "empty" col element (with no styles) for the columns before:<br>
Hide Columns<br>
You can hide columns with the visibility: collapse property:<br>

  <h4>A19 HTML BLOCK & INLINE</h4>
  <p>
      HTML Block and Inline Elements<br>
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.<br>

There are two display values: block and inline.<br>

Block-level Elements<br>
A block-level element always starts on a new line.<br>

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).<br>

A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.<br>
The div element is a block-level element.<br>
Inline Elements<br>
An inline element does not start on a new line.<br>

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.<br>

This is a span element inside a paragrap<br>
Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!<br>

The div Element<br>
The div element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.<br>

The div element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.<br>

When used together with CSS, the div element can be used to style blocks of content:<br>
The span Element<br>
  The span element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.<br>
  
  The span element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.<br>
  
  When used together with CSS, the span element can be used to style parts of the text:<br>
  Chapter Summary<br>

   <h4>A20 HTML CLASSES</h4>
   <p>
      HTML class Attribute<br>
      The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.<br>
      
      Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.<br>
      
      Using The class Attribute<br>
      The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.<br>
      
      In the following example we have three div elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three div elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section:<br>
          In the following example we have two span elements with a class attribute with the value of "note". Both span elements will be styled equally according to the .note style definition in the head section:<br>
          Tip: The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.<br>

          Note: The class name is case sensitive!<br>
          The Syntax For Class<br>
To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}:<br>
Multiple Classes<br>
HTML elements can belong to more than one class.<br>

To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. div class="city main". The element will be styled according to all the classes specified.<br>

In the following example, the first h2 element belongs to both the city class and also to the main class, and will get the CSS styles from both of the classes: <br>
Different Elements Can Share Same Class<br>
Different HTML elements can point to the same class name.<br>

In the following example, both h2 and p points to the "city" class and will share the same style:<br>
Use of The class Attribute in JavaScript<br>
The class name can also be used by JavaScript to perform certain tasks for specific elements.<br>

JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName() method:<br>
Chapter Summary<br>
The HTML class attribute specifies one or more class names for an element<br>
Classes are used by CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements<br>
The class attribute can be used on any HTML element<br>
The class name is case sensitive<br>
Different HTML elements can point to the same class name<br>
JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName() method<br>

   </p>
  <h4>A21 HTML ID</h4>
  <p>
      HTML id Attribute<br>
      The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.<br>
      
      You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.<br>
      
      Using The id Attribute<br>
      The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.<br>
      
      The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.<br>
      
      The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.<br>
      
      In the following example we have an h1 element that points to the id name "myHeader". This h1 element will be styled according to the #myHeader style definition in the head section:<br>
      Note: The id name is case sensitive!<br>

Note: The id name must contain at least one character, cannot start with a number, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.).<br>

Difference Between Class and ID<br>
A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page:<br>
HTML Bookmarks with ID and Links<br>
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.<br>

Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long.<br>

To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link to it.<br>

Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.<br>
Using The id Attribute in JavaScript<br>
The id attribute can also be used by JavaScript to perform some tasks for that specific element.<br>

JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the getElementById() method:<br>
Chapter Summary<br>
The id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element<br>
The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document<br>
The id attribute is used by CSS and JavaScript to style/select a specific element<br>
The value of the id attribute is case sensitive<br>
The id attribute is also used to create HTML bookmarks<br>
JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the getElementById() method<br>


  </p>
  <h4>A22 HTML IFRAMES</h4>
  <p>
      HTML Iframes<br>
      An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.<br>
      HTML Iframe Syntax<br>
The HTML iframe tag specifies an inline frame.<br>

An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.<br>
Tip: It is a good practice to always include a title attribute for the iframe. This is used by screen readers to read out what the content of the iframe is.<br>

  Iframe - Set Height and Width<br>
  Use the height and width attributes to specify the size of the iframe.<br>
  
  The height and width are specified in pixels by default:<br>
  Or you can add the style attribute and use the CSS height and width properties:<br>
  Iframe - Remove the Border<br>
By default, an iframe has a border around it.<br>

To remove the border, add the style attribute and use the CSS border property:<br>
With CSS, you can also change the size, style and color of the iframe's border:<br>
Iframe - Target for a Link<br>
An iframe can be used as the target frame for a link.<br>

The target attribute of the link must refer to the name attribute of the iframe:<br>
Chapter Summary<br>
The HTML iframe tag specifies an inline frame<br>
The src attribute defines the URL of the page to embed<br>
Always include a title attribute (for screen readers)<br>
The height and width attributes specifies the size of the iframe<br>
Use border:none; to remove the border around the iframe<br>

  <h4>A23 HTML JAVASCRIPT</h4>
  <p>
      HTML JavaScript<br>
JavaScript makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.<br>
The HTML script Tag<br>
  The HTML script tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).<br>
  
  The script element either contains script statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.<br>
  
  Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.<br>
  To select an HTML element, JavaScript most often uses the document.getElementById() method.<br>
  
  This JavaScript example writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo":<br>
  A Taste of JavaScript<br>
  Here are some examples of what JavaScript can do:<br>
  The HTML noscript Tag<br>
      The HTML noscript tag defines an alternate content to be displayed to users that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesn't support scripts:<br>
<xmp>
  HTML Script Tags
Tag	Description
script	Defines a client-side script

  </p>
  <h4>A24 HTML FILE PATHS</h4>
  <p>
      HTML File Paths<br>
A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.<br>

File Path Examples<br>
Path	Description<br>
img src="picture.jpg"	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the same folder as the current page<br>
img src="images/picture.jpg"	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder in the current folder<br>
img src="/images/picture.jpg"	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder at the root of the current web<br>
img src="../picture.jpg"	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the folder one level up from the current folder<br>
HTML File Paths<br>
A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.<br>

File paths are used when linking to external files, like:<br>

Web pages<br>
Images<br>
Style sheets<br>
JavaScripts<br>
Absolute File Paths<br>
An absolute file path is the full URL to a file:<br>
Relative File Paths<br>
A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.<br>

In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web:<br>

In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder:<br>
Best Practice<br>
It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).<br>

When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your current base URL. All links will work on your own computer (localhost) as well as on your current public domain and your future public domains.<br>

  </p>
  <h4>A25  HTML HEAD</h4>
  <p>
      HTML - The Head Element<br>
The HTML head element is a container for the following elements: title, style, meta, link, script, and base.<br>

The HTML head Element<br>
The head element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the html tag and the body tag.<br>

HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.<br>

Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.<br>

The HTML title Element<br>
The title element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.<br>

The title element is required in HTML documents!<br>

The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.<br>

The title element:<br>

defines a title in the browser toolbar<br>
provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites<br>
displays a title for the page in search engine-results<br>
So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!<br>

A simple HTML document:<br>
The HTML style Element<br>
  The style element is used to define style information for a single HTML page:<br>
  The HTML link Element<br>
  The link element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.<br>
  
  The link tag is most often used to link to external style sheets:<br>
  The HTML meta Element<br>
The meta element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.<br>

The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but are used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.<br>
Setting The Viewport<br>
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.<br>

You should include the following meta element in all your web pages:<br>

meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.<br>

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).<br>

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.<br>

Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:<br>

Tip: If you are browsing this page with a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links below to see the difference.<br>
The HTML script Element<br>
  The script element is used to define client-side JavaScripts.<br>
  
  The following JavaScript writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo":<br>
  The HTML base Element<br>
The base element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page.<br>

The base tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both.<br>

There can only be one single base element in a document!<br>
Chapter Summary<br>
The head element is a container for metadata (data about data)<br>
The head element is placed between the html tag and the body tag<br>
The title element is required and it defines the title of the document<br>
The style element is used to define style information for a single document<br>
The link tag is most often used to link to external style sheets<br>
The meta element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings<br>
The script element is used to define client-side JavaScripts<br>
The base element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page<br>

  <h4>A26 HTML LAYOUT</h4>
  <p>
      HTML Layout Elements and Techniques<br>
      Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or a newspaper).<br>
      HTML Layout Elements<br>
HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:<br>
HTML Layout Techniques<br>
There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:<br>

CSS framework<br>
CSS float property<br>
CSS flexbox<br>
CSS grid<br>
CSS Frameworks<br>
If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a CSS framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap.<br>

CSS Float Layout<br>
It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility.<br>
CSS Flexbox Layout<br>
Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.<br>
CSS Grid Layout<br>
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.<br>

  </p>
  <h4>A27 HTML RESPONSIVE </h4>
  <p>
      HTML Responsive Web Design<br>
      Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices!<br>
      
      A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.<br>
      What is Responsive Web Design?<br>
Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones):<br>


Setting The Viewport<br>
To create a responsive website, add the following meta tag to all your web pages:<br>
This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.<br>

Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:<br>
Tip: If you are browsing this page on a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links above to see the difference.<br>
Responsive Images<br>
Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.<br>

Using the width Property<br>
If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down:<br>
Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead.<br>

Using the max-width Property<br>
If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size:<br>
Show Different Images Depending on Browser Width<br>
The HTML picture element allows you to define different images for different browser window sizes.<br>

Resize the browser window to see how the image below change depending on the width:<br>
Responsive Text Size
The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width".<br>

That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window:<br>
Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm.<br>

Media Queries<br>
In addition to resize text and images, it is also common to use media queries in responsive web pages.<br>

With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes.<br>

Example: resize the browser window to see that the three div elements below will display horizontally on large screens and stacked vertically on small screens:<br>
Responsive Web Page - Full Example<br>
A responsive web page should look good on large desktop screens and on small mobile phones.<br>
Responsive Web Design - Frameworks<br>
All popular CSS Frameworks offer responsive design.<br>

They are free, and easy to use.<br>

W3.CSS<br>
W3.CSS is a modern CSS framework with support for desktop, tablet, and mobile design by default.<br>

W3.CSS is smaller and faster than similar CSS frameworks.<br>

W3.CSS is designed to be a high quality alternative to Bootstrap.<br>

W3.CSS is designed to be independent of jQuery or any other JavaScript library.<br>
Bootstrap<br>
Another popular CSS framework is Bootstrap. Bootstrap uses HTML, CSS and jQuery to make responsive web pages.<br>

   <h4>A28 HTML COMPUTERCODE</h4>
   <p>
      HTML Computer Code Elements<br>
      HTML contains several elements for defining user input and computer code.<br>
      HTML kbd For Keyboard Input<br>
          The HTML kbd element is used to define keyboard input. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.<br>
          HTML samp For Program Output<br>
              The HTML samp element is used to define sample output from a computer program. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.<br>
              HTML code For Computer Code<br>
                  The HTML code element  is used to define a piece of computer code. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.<br>
                  Notice that the code element does not preserve extra whitespace and line-breaks.<br>

                      To fix this, you can put the code element inside a pre element:<br>
                      HTML var For Variables<br>
                          The HTML var element  is used to define a variable in programming or in a mathematical expression. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.<br>

      <h4>A29 HTML SEMANTICS</h4>
      <p>
          HTML Semantic Elements<br>
          Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.<br>
          
          What are Semantic Elements?<br>
          A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.<br>
          
          Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span - Tells nothing about its content.<br>
          
          Examples of semantic elements: form, table, and article - Clearly defines its content.<br>
          
          Semantic Elements in HTML<br>
          Many web sites contain HTML code like: div id="nav" div class="header" div id="footer" to indicate navigation, header, and footer.<br>
          
          In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page: <br>
          HTML section Element<br>
              The section element defines a section in a document.<br>
              
              According to W3C's HTML documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."<br>
              
              Examples of where a section element can be used:<br>
              
              Chapters<br>
              Introduction<br>
              News items<br>
              Contact information<br>
              A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.<br>
              HTML article Element<br>
                  The article element specifies independent, self-contained content.<br>
                  
                  An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.<br>
                  
                  Examples of where the article element can be used:<br>
                  
                  Forum posts<br>
                  Blog posts<br>
                  User comments<br>
                  Product cards<br>
                  Newspaper articles<br>
                  Nesting article in section or Vice Versa?<br>
                      The article element specifies independent, self-contained content.<br>
                      
                      The section element defines section in a document.<br>
                      
                      Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!<br>
                      
                      So, you will find HTML pages with section elements containing article elements, and article elements containing section elements.<br>
                      
                      HTML header Element<br>
                      The header element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.<br>
                      
                      A header element typically contains:<br>
                      
                      one or more heading elements (h1 - h6)<br>
                      logo or icon<br>
                      authorship information<br>
                      Note: You can have several header elements in one HTML document. However, header cannot be placed within a footer, address or another header element.<br>
                      HTML footer Element<br>
                          The footer element defines a footer for a document or section.<br>
                          
                          A footer element typically contains:<br>
                          
                          authorship information<br>
                          copyright information<br>
                          contact information<br>
                          sitemap<br>
                          back to top links<br>
                          related documents<br>
                          You can have several footer elements in one document.<br>
                          HTML nav Element<br>
                              The nav element defines a set of navigation links.<br>
                              
                              Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a nav element. The nav element is intended only for major block of navigation links.<br>
                              
                              Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.<br>
                              HTML aside Element
                                  The aside element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).<br>
                                  
                                  The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.<br>
                                  HTML figure and figcaption Elements
                                      The figure tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.<br>
                                      
                                      The figcaption tag defines a caption for a figure element. The figcaption element can be placed as the first or as the last child of a figure element.<br>
                                      
                                      The img element defines the actual image/illustration.  <br>
                                      Why Semantic Elements?<br>
                                      According to the W3C: "A semantic Web allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities."<br>

      <h4>A30 HTML STYLE GUIDE</h4>
      <p>
          HTML Style Guide and Coding Conventions<br>
          A consistent, clean, and tidy HTML code makes it easier for others to read and understand your code.<br>
          
          Here are some guidelines and tips for creating good HTML code.<br>
          
          Always Declare Document Type<br>
          Always declare the document type as the first line in your document.<br>
          
          The correct document type for HTML is:<br>
          Use Lowercase Element Names<br>
HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in element names.<br>

However, we recommend using lowercase element names, because:<br>

Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad<br>
Developers normally use lowercase names<br>
Lowercase looks cleaner<br>
Lowercase is easier to write<br>
Close All HTML Elements<br>
In HTML, you do not have to close all elements (for example the p element).<br>

However, we strongly recommend closing all HTML elements, like this:<br>
Use Lowercase Attribute Names<br>
HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in attribute names.<br>

However, we recommend using lowercase attribute names, because:<br>

Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad<br>
Developers normally use lowercase names<br>
Lowercase look cleaner<br>
Lowercase are easier to write<br>
Always Quote Attribute Values<br>
HTML allows attribute values without quotes.<br>

However, we recommend quoting attribute values, because:<br>

Developers normally quote attribute values<br>
Quoted values are easier to read<br>
You MUST use quotes if the value contains spaces<br>
Always Specify alt, width, and height for Images<br>
Always specify the alt attribute for images. This attribute is important if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.<br>

Also, always define the width and height of images. This reduces flickering, because the browser can reserve space for the image before loading.<br>
Spaces and Equal Signs<br>
HTML allows spaces around equal signs. But space-less is easier to read and groups entities better together.<br>
Avoid Long Code Lines<br>
When using an HTML editor, it is NOT convenient to scroll right and left to read the HTML code.<br>

Try to avoid too long code lines.<br>

Blank Lines and Indentation<br>
Do not add blank lines, spaces, or indentations without a reason.<br>

For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks.<br>

For readability, add two spaces of indentation. Do not use the tab key.<br>
Never Skip the title Element<br>
  The title element is required in HTML.<br>
  
  The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.<br>
  
  The title element:<br>
  
  defines a title in the browser toolbar<br>
  provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites<br>
  displays a title for the page in search-engine results<br>
  So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible<br>
  Omitting html and body?<br>
      An HTML page will validate without the html and body tags:<br>
      However, we strongly recommend to always add the html and body tags!<br>

          Omitting body can produce errors in older browsers.<br>
          
          Omitting html and body can also crash DOM and XML software.<br>
          
          Omitting head?<br>
          The HTML head tag can also be omitted.<br>
          
          Browsers will add all elements before body, to a default head element.<br>
          However, we recommend using the head tag.<br>

              Close Empty HTML Elements?<br>
              In HTML, it is optional to close empty elements.<br>
              If you expect XML/XHTML software to access your page, keep the closing slash (/), because it is required in XML and XHTML.<br>

Add the lang Attribute<br>
You should always include the lang attribute inside the html tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.<br>
Meta Data<br>
To ensure proper interpretation and correct search engine indexing, both the language and the character encoding meta charset="charset" should be defined as early as possible in an HTML document:<br>
Setting The Viewport<br>
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.<br>

You should include the following meta element in all your web pages:<br>

meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"<br>
This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.<br>

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).<br>

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.<br>

Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:<br>

Tip: If you are browsing this page with a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links below to see the difference.<br>
HTML Comments<br>
Short comments should be written on one line, like this:<br>
Comments that spans more than one line, should be written like this:<br>
Long comments are easier to observe if they are indented with two spaces.<br>

Using Style Sheets<br>
Use simple syntax for linking to style sheets (the type attribute is not necessary):<br>
Short CSS rules can be written compressed, like this:<br>
Long CSS rules should be written over multiple lines:<br>
Place the opening bracket on the same line as the selector<br>
Use one space before the opening bracket<br>
Use two spaces of indentation<br>
Use semicolon after each property-value pair, including the last<br>
Only use quotes around values if the value contains spaces<br>
Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces<br>
Loading JavaScript in HTML<br>
Use simple syntax for loading external scripts (the type attribute is not necessary):<br>
Accessing HTML Elements with JavaScript<br>
Using "untidy" HTML code can result in JavaScript errors.<br>

These two JavaScript statements will produce different results:<br>
Use Lower Case File Names<br>
Some web servers (Apache, Unix) are case sensitive about file names: "london.jpg" cannot be accessed as "London.jpg".<br>

Other web servers (Microsoft, IIS) are not case sensitive: "london.jpg" can be accessed as "London.jpg".<br>

If you use a mix of uppercase and lowercase, you have to be aware of this.<br>
If you move from a case-insensitive to a case-sensitive server, even small errors will break your web!<br>

To avoid these problems, always use lowercase file names!<br>

File Extensions<br>
HTML files should have a .html extension (.htm is allowed).<br>

CSS files should have a .css extension.<br>

JavaScript files should have a .js extension.<br>

Differences Between .htm and .html?<br>
There is no difference between the .htm and .html file extensions!<br>

Both will be treated as HTML by any web browser and web server.<br>

Default Filenames<br>
When a URL does not specify a filename at the end (like "https://www.91hun.in/"), the server just adds a default filename, such as "index.html", "index.htm", "default.html", or "default.htm".<br>

If your server is configured only with "index.html" as the default filename, your file must be named "index.html", and not "default.html".<br>

However, servers can be configured with more than one default filename; usually you can set up as many default filenames as you want.<br>

      <h4>A31 HTML ENTITIES</h4>
      <p>
          HTML Entities<br>
          Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.<br>
          
          HTML Entities<br>
          Some characters are reserved in HTML.<br>
          
          If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.<br>
          
          Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.<br>
          
          A character entity looks like this:<br>
          To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;<br>

Advantage of using an entity name: An entity name is easy to remember.<br>
Disadvantage of using an entity name: Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for entity numbers is good.<br>

Non-breaking Space<br>
A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;<br>

A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.<br>

Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.<br>

Examples:<br>

§ 10<br>
10 km/h<br>
10 PM<br>
Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages.<br>

If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity.<br>

Tip: The non-breaking hyphen (&#8209;) is used to define a hyphen character (‑) that does not break into a new line.<br>

  Combining Diacritical Marks
A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter.

Some diacritical marks, like grave (  ̀) and acute (  ́) are called accents.

Diacritical marks can appear both above and below a letter, inside a letter, and between two letters.

Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters to produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used in the page.

Here are some examples:

Mark	Character	Construct	Result
̀	a	a&#768;	à
́	a	a&#769;	á
̂	a	a&#770;	â
̃	a	a&#771;	ã
̀	O	O&#768;	Ò
́	O	O&#769;	Ó
̂	O	O&#770;	Ô
̃	O	O&#771;	Õ

       <h4>A32 HTML SYMBOLS</h4>
       <p>
          HTML Symbols
          Symbols that are not present on your keyboard can also be added by using entities.
          
          HTML Symbol Entities
          HTML entities were described in the previous chapter.
          
          Many mathematical, technical, and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard.
          
          To add such symbols to an HTML page, you can use the entity name or the entity number (a decimal or a hexadecimal reference) for the symbol.

       <h4> A33 HTML EMOJIS</h4>
       <p>
          Using Emojis in HTML<br>
          Emojis are characters from the UTF-8 character set: 😄 😍 💗<br>
          
          What are Emojis?<br>
          Emojis look like images, or icons, but they are not.<br>
          
          They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode) character set.<br>
          
          UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.<br>
          
          The HTML charset Attribute<br>
          To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.<br>
          
          This is specified in the meta tag:<br>
          If not specified, UTF-8 is the default character set in HTML.<br>

UTF-8 Characters<br>
Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on a keyboard, but they can always be displayed using numbers (called entity numbers):<br>

A is 65<br>
B is 66<br>
C is 67<br>
Emoji Characters<br>
Emojis are also characters from the UTF-8 alphabet:<br>

😄 is 128516<br>
😍 is 128525<br>
💗 is 128151<br>
Since Emojis are characters, they can be copied, displayed, and sized just like any other character in HTML.<br>

      <h4> A34 HTML CHARSET</h4>
      <p>
          HTML Encoding (Character Sets)<br>
          To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use.<br>
          
          From ASCII to UTF-8<br>
          ASCII was the first character encoding standard. ASCII defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet: numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > .<br>
          
          ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set supported 256 different character codes. HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.<br>
          
          ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set. ANSI is identical to ISO-8859-1, except that ANSI has 32 extra characters.<br>
          
          The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!<br>
          
          The HTML charset Attribute<br>
          To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.<br>
          
          This is specified in the meta tag:<br>

      <h4>A35 HTML URL ENCODE</h4>
      <p>
          HTML Uniform Resource Locators<br>
          A URL is another word for a web address.<br>
          
          A URL can be composed of words (e.g. 91hub.in), or an Internet Protocol (IP) address (e.g. 192.68.20.50).<br>
          
          Most people enter the name when surfing, because names are easier to remember than numbers.<br>
          
          URL - Uniform Resource Locator<br>
          Web browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL.<br>
          
          A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to address a document (or other data) on the web.<br>
          <xmp>
              Common URL Schemes
              The table below lists some common schemes:
              
              Scheme	Short for	Used for
              http	HyperText Transfer Protocol	Common web pages. Not encrypted
              https	Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol	Secure web pages. Encrypted
              ftp	File Transfer Protocol	Downloading or uploading files
              file	 	A file on your computer
               
          </xmp>
          URL Encoding<br>
URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. If a URL contains characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted.<br>

URL encoding converts non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.<br>

URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a "%" followed by hexadecimal digits.<br>

URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign, or %20.<br>
Try It Yourself<br>
If you click "Submit", the browser will URL encode the input before it is sent to the server.<br>

A page at the server will display the received input.<br>

Try some other input and click Submit again.<br>
<xmp>
  ASCII Encoding Examples
Your browser will encode input, according to the character-set used in your page.

The default character-set in HTML5 is UTF-8.

      <h4>A36 HTML VS XHTM</h4>
      <p>
          HTML Versus XHTML<br>
          XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML.<br>
          
          What is XHTML?<br>
          XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language<br>
          XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML<br>
          XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application<br>
          XHTML is supported by all major browsers<br>
          Why XHTML?<br>
          XML is a markup language where all documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed").<br>
          
          XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML). In addition, browsers ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the markup. So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling.<br>
          The Most Important Differences from HTML<br>
<!DOCTYPE> is mandatory<br>
The xmlns attribute in html is mandatory<br>
html, head, title, and body are mandatory<br>
Elements must always be properly nested<br>
Elements must always be closed<br>
Elements must always be in lowercase<br>
Attribute names must always be in lowercase<br>
Attribute values must always be quoted<br>
Attribute minimization is forbidden<br>
XHTML - !DOCTYPE .... Is Mandatory<br>
An XHTML document must have an XHTML <!DOCTYPE> declaration.<br>

The html, head, title, and body elements must also be present, and the xmlns attribute in html must specify the xml namespace for the document.<br>
XHTML Elements Must be Properly Nested<br>
In XHTML, elements must always be properly nested within each other, like this:<br>
XHTML Elements Must Always be Closed<br>
In XHTML, elements must always be closed, like this:<br>
XHTML Empty Elements Must Always be Closed<br>
In XHTML, empty elements must always be closed, like this:<br>
